# Your project ECE3140 page!

You can modify this page to create your final project. Right now, the page is generated from a Markdown file (index.md) you can edit it directly from the git web interface or push to the `page` branch. There are a few standard themes that github provides and this is the "basic" one. If you'd like to change it, you can edit the `\_config.yml` file. 

The Markdown interface is easy, but if you would like to do something more fancy you can just add an index.html file to the branch (and any supporitng style sheets) and it will be served as the webpage instead. 

# Expected page structure.
