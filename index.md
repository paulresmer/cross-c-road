# Your project ECE3140 page!

You can modify this page to create your final project parge. Right now, the page is generated from a Markdown file (index.md) in the `page` branch. You can edit it directly from the git web interface or push to the `page` branch. There are a few [standard themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) provides. This one is `minimal`. If you'd like to change it, you can edit the `\_config.yml` file.

The Markdown interface is easy, but if you would like to do something more fancy you can just add an index.html file to the branch (and any supporitng style sheets etc.) and it will be served as the webpage instead. 

# Expected page structure. 

We would like your final project page to have the following structure:
- A very catchy title.
- An overview section about the project.
- A system diagrm that shows the major hw/sw components and how they interact. 
- A short video. This should be 3-4 minutes and cover:
  - Who you are
  - Project title and idea
  - Technical approach
  - A demo of the working product
  - Any technical difficulties you faced / or your testing debugging approach. Conceptually, think of what a YOU would have liked to know BEFORE you started this project.
  - Keep to the times since we will ask students to watch a bunch of these. If you want a longer video that goes into more detail you can add anohter one in the technical section. 
- Technical approach (This should be more detailed than the information).
- Testing / Debugging aproach.
- Team work (if applicable)
- Outside Resrouces

So the headings we exped would be

### Overview
This should have the video and the system diagram in it.
### Technical Approach
Use pictures/diagram where appropriate
### Testing and Debugging
Talk about your testing approach or subtle bugs you made/found
### Team Work 
How did you coordinte? Who was responsible for what. You can skip this section if you work alone. 
### Outside Resources
If you are using a code base from outside of class, or found a particular resource helpful, please put it here.
