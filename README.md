# Project Descriptions for Team jse77-pgr39

## jse77

We intend to design and implement a version of the arcade action game Frogger, where the player controls a frog and directs it through traffic. The objective of the game is to live for as long as possible.Â 
# Feedback

I assume the game would run on a computer? You can totally use the board as in input device for a game, but you need to make sure that some significant amount of the processing happens on the board. Just sending buttons press events is not complex enough. There are a few ways you can expand on this, either you do some level selecting game logic at startup and send that over to set up the game, or you could use a sensor that needs some on-board processing like decoding tilts and/or the capacitive touch sensor. 

# Project Web-Page

The project web-pages will also be hosted on github in this repo in the "page" branch. You can edit it by switching branches and modifying the files, or by pushing to the branch. Here is a link to a minmal web-page that you can edit and modify: [https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2024/jse77-pgr39](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2024/jse77-pgr39)
